 For long, language remains a concern to those who are worried about the nature of the language and the way it stands for the world. Not only in western tradition but also in our Indian tradition we have seen several schools of thoughts wrestling with each other on different issues related to language. Two such schools are the school of the grammarians and the school of the logicians.
<p> 
  It is well known that the grammarians and logicians differ from each other while dealing with the language. In today's world this difference can be best perceived in the way Chomskian approach varies from the approaches of the Montague. In modern time though we have developed enough understanding about the way these two school differ from each other, very little is known to the linguists how this debate once originated in India in the work of Bhartrihari and Dignaga as an embodiment of two different ways of living, namely the Brahminism and the Buddhism.

 <p>
  The debate existing between Bhartrihari and Dignaga is significant not only for understanding the way their works explain different linguistic phenomenon. Their significance also lies with the facts of their originations. By virtue of being belonging to two separate sects their attitude towards the worldly phenomena and the respective analytical interpretative mechanisms, for sure, have some definite impacts on their proposals â€“ i.e. Vakyapadiyam and Pramanasamuccaya.
